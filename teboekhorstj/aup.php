    <h1>Acceptable use policy</h1>
    <p>This acceptable use policy (“Policy”) sets forth the general guidelines and acceptable and prohibited uses of

        website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”).
        This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Website operator
        (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other
        legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case
        the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you
        do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use
        the Website and Services. By accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have
        read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement
        is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by
        you, and it governs your use of the Website and Services.</p>
